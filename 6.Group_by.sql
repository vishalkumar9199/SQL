-- GROUP BY Examples in SQL
-- =============================================
-- This file demonstrates various examples of using GROUP BY in SQL queries
-- for data summarization and aggregation operations.

-- Database Setup
-- =============================================
CREATE DATABASE db_for_group_by;
USE db_for_group_by;

-- Table Creation
-- =============================================
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    joining_date DATE
);

-- Initial Data Insertion
-- =============================================
INSERT INTO employees (name, department, salary, joining_date) VALUES
('Alice', 'HR', 50000, '2020-06-15'),
('Bob', 'HR', 55000, '2019-08-20'),
('Charlie', 'IT', 70000, '2018-03-25'),
('David', 'IT', 72000, '2017-07-10'),
('Eve', 'IT', 73000, '2021-02-15'),
('Frank', 'Finance', 60000, '2020-11-05'),
('Grace', 'Finance', 65000, '2019-05-30'),
('Hannah', 'Finance', 62000, '2021-01-12');

-- Additional Data Insertion
-- =============================================
INSERT INTO employees (name, department, salary, joining_date) VALUES
('Tim', 'HR', 65000, '2019-05-30'),
('Tom', 'IT', 62000, '2021-01-12');

-- View All Employee Data
-- =============================================
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Example 1: Count Employees in Each Department
-- =============================================
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department;

-- Example 2: Get the Average Salary Per Department
-- =============================================
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department;

-- Example 3: Get the Highest and Lowest Salary Per Department
-- =============================================
SELECT department, MIN(salary) AS lowest_salary, MAX(salary) AS highest_salary 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department;

-- Example 4: Count Employees Per Department and Joining Year
-- =============================================
SELECT department, YEAR(joining_date) AS joining_year, COUNT(*) AS employee_count 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY joining_year, department;

-- Example 5: Order Departments by the Highest Average Salary
-- =============================================
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;

-- Example 6: Group by Calculated Salary Range
-- =============================================
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN salary < 60000 THEN 'Low Salary'
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 60000 AND 70000 THEN 'Medium Salary'
        ELSE 'High Salary'
    END AS salary_range,
    COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees 
GROUP BY salary_range;

-- Example 7: Find Department with the Maximum Number of Employees
-- =============================================
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department 
ORDER BY total_employees DESC 
LIMIT 1;

-- Example 8: Find Departments With More Than 2 Employees (With Conditions)
-- =============================================
SELECT 
    department, 
    AVG(salary) AS average_salary, 
    COUNT(*) AS total_employees 
FROM employees 
WHERE joining_date > '2017-07-10' 
GROUP BY department 
HAVING total_employees > 2 AND average_salary > 55000;
